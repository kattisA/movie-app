# Project Title

Movie app based on tutorial for learning purposes. During this project I learned more about:
* Using API:s and more specifically the OMDB API
* React application in general
* React hooks
* Local storage for desktop applications

## Description

A React app using the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) displaying movies. CSS Framework is Bootstrap.

## Getting Started

After cloning the project run npm install. To start the project type npm start in the console and to stop ctrl + C.

### Dependencies

* Node and npm
* React
* Bootstrap

### Installing

Use npm install. You can learn more in the
[Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

### Executing program

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
